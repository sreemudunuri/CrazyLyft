# The Driving Dead

* [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBvCOW5FHKU&t=76s)

Inspired by Crazy Taxi and Pac Man, The Driving Dead is a browser game in which the user, driving a taxi, has to rush to collect(run over) as many passengers (zombies) as possible. This is a single page application, entirely written with Javascript. Users and scores are saved to a Rails backend [here](https://github.com/jarretbryan/crazyLyft-backend) which provides the API to manage user data and scores.

The HTML is styled with modified bootstrap, and the game itself uses the HTML5 Canvas, with JS providing the functionality.

This was built by [jarretbryan](https://github.com/jarretbryan), [sreemudunuri](https://github.com/sreemudunuri) & [WolfgangPfretzschner](https://github.com/WolfgangPfretzschner).
